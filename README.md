# Dictionary App

An application developed for users to search for the words they are curious about, add them to their favorites, and browse the words they have previously searched, with the help of an API. The word boxes are designed to be collapsible, and when the user opens a word box, the word is added to the search history.

It is designed with MVVM architecture and uses Coroutines, Room, Dagger-Hilt, Retrofit, Paging 3 and some other libraries.
